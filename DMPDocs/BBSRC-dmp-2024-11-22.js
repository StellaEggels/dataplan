                    existing data sets and relies on them. #if$_RNASEQ For example, without a proper genomic
                    reference it is very difficult to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data
                    sets. #endif$_RNASEQ It is also important to include existing data-sets on the expression and
                    metabolic behavior of the $_STUDYOBJECT, and on existing background knowledge. #if$_PARTNERS of
                    the partners: $_PARTNERS #endif$_PARTNERS Genomic references can be gathered from reference databases for
                    genomes/ and sequences, like the NCBI (US National Center for Biotechnology Information),
                    EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) and DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan). Furthermore, prior
                    &#39;unstructured&#39; data in the form of publications and data contained therein will be used
                    for decision making.</span></li>
            <li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Secondary Use <br> &ndash; The data will not only initially benefit the
                    $_PROJECTNAME partners, but will also be made available to selected stakeholders closely involved in
                    the project, and then the scientific community working on $_STUDYOBJECT. $_DATAUTILITY In
                    addition, the general public interested in $_STUDYOBJECT can also use the data after
                    publication. The data will be disseminated according to $_PROJECTNAME&#39;s dissemination and
                    communication plan, #if$_DATAPLANT which aligns with DataPLANT platform or other means #endif$_DATAPLANT.</span></li>

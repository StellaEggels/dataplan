                At the moment, we do not anticipate ethical or legal issues with data sharing. In terms of ethics,
                since this is plant data, there is no need for an ethics committee, however, diligence for plant
                resource benefit
                sharing is considered. #issuewarning Please ensure that you complete any necessary due diligence. Currently, we are awaiting clarification on whether the Nagoya Protocol (🡺 see Nagoya Protocol) will encompass sequence information. Regardless, if you use material from a country other than your own (or that of your partner), and you conduct physical or biochemical characterization (e.g., metabolites, proteome, RNASeq, etc.), this may constitute an action relevant under the Nagoya Protocol. Exceptions might include materials from countries such as the U.S. (non-partner), Ireland (has not signed—still contact them), etc., though other laws could apply.
